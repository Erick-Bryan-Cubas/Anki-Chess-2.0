- **language**: interface language. `"en"` (default), `"pt-BR"`, or `"auto"` to follow Anki's interface language. The menu entry updates after restarting Anki; the dialog updates the next time it opens.
- **preview_template**: `true` (default) makes the AnkiChess note types load the preview of the
  AnkiChess template shipped in this add-on, with the improvements proposed to the AnkiChess project
  and not released there yet. Only the script the cards load changes; their HTML, styling and
  settings stay. It applies while the official template is the version the preview builds on: a
  newer official version (installed by the Companion add-on) is kept. `false` goes back to the
  official script.
- **deck_root**: root deck for everything imported (set here; the import windows don't ask for it).
  Empty = `Chess` (English) or `Xadrez` (pt-BR). Each Lichess study goes to
  `<root>::<study>::Opening lines`, `::Tactics` and `::Annotated games` (opening lines are tagged
  `opening::<family>::<variation>`); Chess.com cards go to `<root>::Openings::<family>` and
  `<root>::My games::<error type>`. Re-importing with "update" moves older notes into this layout.
- **study_decks** / **chapter_decks**: deck names chosen in the import window (the study deck, typed
  or picked with Choose…, and the subdeck of a chapter), by study and by chapter, so that importing
  the study again uses them. A study deck that no longer exists gives way to the deck the study's
  notes are in. Filled by the window; remove an entry (or use Default names) to go back to the
  default name.
- **include_games**: select full-game chapters (no FEN) by default.
- **split_lines**: one note per variation of the opening lines (each branch from the start to its end).
- **key_moves**: besides each full game, a "find the move" note for every move marked ! or !!,
  in the study's Key moves subdeck.
- **update_existing**: on re-import, update notes already imported instead of skipping them.
- **strip_anno**: remove the `[%anno ...]` markers Lichess leaves in comments.
- **base_note_type**: note type the Flipped/Study ones are cloned from, when a chapter or card needs
  one that doesn't exist yet. Empty = `AnkiChess`, or the first chess note type set up as a puzzle.
- **lichess_token**: personal token to download private studies (`study:read` scope) and your puzzle
  activity (`puzzle:read` scope). With it Lichess limits study downloads by account (3 at a time)
  instead of by IP (1 at a time). Stored as plain text; set it with **Lichess token…** at the bottom
  of the import window, which checks it with Lichess.
- **lichess_token_user**: the Lichess account of the token, found when it was checked (shown in the
  import window).
- **lichess_username**: last user whose studies were listed (`User's studies…`).
- **puzzle_max** / **puzzle_all**: how many of your latest puzzles to load, or your whole puzzle history.
- **puzzle_failed_only**: loading checks only the failed puzzles (the last of the "All" and "Only the failed
  ones" buttons clicked).
- **puzzle_fetch_games**: fetch each imported puzzle's game, so the card starts with the opponent's last
  move (about 0.6 s per puzzle). `false` imports the puzzles of your activity at once, starting at the
  puzzle position.
- **puzzle_deck**: deck of the Lichess puzzles. Empty = `<root>::Lichess puzzles`.
- **puzzle_sync_failed_only**: the puzzle sync imports only the puzzles you failed (`false`: all of them).
- **puzzle_sync_on_open**: sync the puzzles when the profile opens, quietly, once a first sync was made
  with "Sync now".
- **puzzle_sync_button**: the button at the end of Anki's menu bar (after Help) that syncs the puzzles in
  one click.
- **puzzle_sync_since** / **puzzle_sync_at**: where the next sync starts reading your puzzle activity and
  when the last one ran (ms; written by the sync). `0` = never synced: the next sync goes through your
  whole history.
- **puzzle_sync_layout**: the deck and tag layout the sync left the imported puzzles in (written by the
  sync). Lower than the add-on's: the next sync reads the whole history once and moves them.

**Games** (`Tools > Import into AnkiChess...`, Games tab):

- **chesscom_usernames**: your Chess.com and Lichess usernames; used to pick your side automatically.
- **chesscom_user** / **lichess_user**: your usernames for **My games…** (your latest games).
- **chesscom_kinds**: card types selected last time (empty = default selection).
- **analysis_time**: Stockfish seconds per move (the positions that become cards get 3x more).
- **stockfish_path**: Stockfish executable. Empty = the one downloaded by the add-on (`user_files/stockfish`) or `stockfish` on the PATH.
